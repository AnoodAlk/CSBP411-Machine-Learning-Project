The Global Earthquake Database (GED) has been used to develop a machine learning model to predict the total number of deaths resulting from earthquakes. Using the Weka software, the earthquake data had been analyzed from the GED to identify patterns and relationships between factors such as magnitude, location, and other characteristics and the number of fatalities. By training the model on historical data, it can be used to predict the potential impact of future earthquakes and inform disaster response efforts. This type of analysis has the potential to improve our understanding of the complex factors that contribute to earthquake fatalities and can help to inform policies aimed at reducing the impact of earthquakes on human life.
